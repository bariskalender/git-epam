# Sports Store Application

## Description

The `SportsStore` application is a comprehensive e-commerce solution that demonstrates modern web development practices using .NET 8. This application follows the classic architecture pattern commonly used by online stores worldwide.

## Application Features

Upon completing this task, you will have a fully functional application that implements the following features:
- An online product catalog where customers can browse products by category and page
- A shopping cart system where users can add and remove products
- A checkout process where customers can enter delivery details
- An administration area with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for managing products and orders

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes the .NET 8 platform with the following tools and frameworks:
- .NET 8 SDK
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- ASP.NET Core MVC

## Development Environment

**Visual Studio 2022** is the recommended IDE for this project, as it provides the most convenient development experience. However, if your development machine doesn't have Visual Studio 2022 configured, you can use:
- Visual Studio Code with the .NET 8 SDK
- Any other IDE that supports .NET development

## Project Structure

The development process is divided into five sequential steps, each building upon the previous one. Each step has its own feature branch with detailed documentation:

| Step | Description | Feature Branch Name |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1. | Building the basic infrastructure for the SportsStore application | step-1 |
| 2. | Creating a simple domain model with a product repository supported by SQL Server and Entity Framework Core. Developing the HomeController for paginated product lists. Implementing clean URL schemes and basic styling | step-2 |
| 3. | Implementing category-based navigation and basic shopping cart functionality | step-3 |
| 4. | Completing the shopping cart system with a comprehensive checkout process | step-4 |
| 5. | Implementing full CRUD operations for product management and order processing capabilities | step-5 |

After completing all steps, you will have the final version of the application in the `main` branch.

## Project Configuration

Each project file in the solution must be properly configured:

### 1. PropertyGroup Configuration
Your `<PropertyGroup>` section should contain the following lines:
```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<EnableNETAnalyzers>true</EnableNETAnalyzers>
<AnalysisMode>AllEnabledByDefault</AnalysisMode>
```

### 2. EditorConfig Configuration
The project includes a comprehensive `.editorconfig` file that automatically configures:
- Code style conventions
- Naming conventions
- Formatting rules
- Analyzer rule severities
- C# specific settings

This configuration is automatically applied to all C# files in the project.
